Automated Multi-Class Brain Tumor Classification Using MRI Images Based On Custom Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning \&amp; Ensemble Approaches.

Proposed three novel custom CNN models and an ensemble approach model combining fine-tuned pretrained models, and implemented transfer learning models, achieving optimal accuracy on two Brain MRI datasets with model averaging ensemble.
